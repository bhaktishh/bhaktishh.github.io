    <p>Very broadly: I'm interested in programming languages. I like knowing that the software I'm writing and using is correct.</p>
   <p> More specifically: Verification is cool. Unfortunately verification is hard. I want to make it easier for people to verify their software,
    and I want to make tools that make verification less of a pain for an average developer than it is currently. I want tools that can improve 
    productivity industrially rather than academically. 
</p>
<p>Obviously, I am very early in my journey as a researcher, so there is a lot for me to still explore, which just means I'm probably interested
    in a much wider range of topics than the one I talk about above. It is not difficult to convince me to explore something that doesn't fit into
    what I've worked on/explored in the past, and chances are this page will have some more additions the next time you look at it.
